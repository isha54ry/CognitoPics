# Smart Gallery

Smart Gallery is a privacy-focused, AI-powered photo gallery application that uses facial recognition 
to detect and match faces within a user's photo collection. It allows users to hide selected images in 
a password-protected vault using AES encryption, ensuring sensitive images remain private. 

Built with Python and Streamlit, the app features a responsive and modern UI with organized tabs, 
image previews, and smooth navigation. All operations, including encryption and decryption, are 
handled locally, and no internet or cloud storage is involved â€” making Smart Gallery a secure, 
offline-first solution for personal photo management.
