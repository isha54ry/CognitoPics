# CognitoPics

CognitoPics is a privacy-focused, AI-powered photo gallery application that uses facial recognition 
to detect and match faces within a user's photo collection. It allows users to hide selected images in 
a password-protected vault using AES encryption, ensuring sensitive images remain private. 

Built with Python and Streamlit, the app features a responsive and modern UI with organized tabs, 
image previews, and smooth navigation. All operations, including encryption and decryption, are 
handled locally, and no internet or cloud storage is involved â€” making Smart Gallery a secure, 
offline-first solution for personal photo management.

##  Future Enhancements

The Smart Gallery project is designed with scalability and innovation in mind. Below are some planned improvements and advanced features to be integrated in future iterations:

- **Mobile App UI Integration**  
  Develop a dedicated mobile interface to bring Smart Gallery features to Android/iOS platforms for enhanced accessibility and convenience.

- **Visual Redesign (Locker / Netflix-style UI)**  
  Implement a more engaging and immersive user interface with thematic layouts like a secure photo locker or a Netflix-style image grid for better visual appeal.

- **Backend Migration to Flask or FastAPI**  
  Shift to a backend framework like Flask for more flexibility, allowing features like user authentication, file management APIs, and deeper customization.

- **Login System & Multi-user Support**  
  Add secure user authentication to personalize and isolate vaults, enabling safe usage across different users.

- **Cloud Storage Option**  
  Integrate encrypted cloud storage (like AWS S3 or Firebase) for secure remote backups, while maintaining privacy-first principles.

- **Face Blur / Auto-Hide Filters**  
  Introduce optional filters to auto-blur or conceal sensitive faces dynamically based on user-defined rules.

- **Activity Logs and Notifications**  
  Log important events like image uploads or unlock attempts and provide basic notifications or audit trails.



## Notes

* All encryption and image handling is done locally on the user's device.
* No images are uploaded or stored externally.
* Make sure the required folders (`dataset`, `photos`, `locked_photos`) exist before running.
* Make sure to install all dependencies using:
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
